This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Next steps
-[ ] move away from Pinecode (probably to something simple, self hosted, like Weaviate or PG Vector) as I like to have true ownership over the platform that is hosting my data (What if Pinecone changes pricing/privacy policy/terms of service)?
-[ ] pagination
-[ ] authentication
-[ ] no caching
-[ ] i'm not using row level security - it's just faster to do it without RLS
- I now have a flat db table, not very efficient in case you want to search for multiple tweets from the same user - plus we are storing duplicated data.  

With more time
- I would improve the UI
- I would make it more secure, scalable and efficient
